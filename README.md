# Psychic-Game
A letter guessing game using HTML and JavaScript. 

This is a letter guessing game created using HTML and JavaScript. A user has chances to guess a letter randomly chosen by the computer. If they choose correctly, they win, if not they lose. Guesses are shown.

This provides an example of simple code that targets HTML elements using JavaScript and manipulates them using the DOM.
